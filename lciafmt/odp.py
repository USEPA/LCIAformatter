Key Assumptions: 
     # compounds with ODP or GWP == 0 are excluded from the respective method.
     # Table A-5 footnote GWP/GTP Footnote:
        #"GWP and GTP values that are less then 0.1 are reported as “<<1” in the table. GWP and GTP values that are between 0.1 and 1
        are reported as “<1” in the table."
     # Table A-5 footnote O11 states that values with < symbol are the upper limit of identified values
     # compounds with a GWP and ODP labeled '<x' are set equal to 1*x
     # compounds with a GWP labeled '<<x' are set equal to 0.1*x
     # compounds with a ODP labeled '>' are set equal to 1*x. No guidance was identified to inform selection of a higher number. 
     # compounds with a GWP labeled '~' are set equal to x.

     # The original file contains no context information. All flowables are assigned the context 'Elementary flows/emission/air'.
