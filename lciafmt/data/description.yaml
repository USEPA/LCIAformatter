    [Method] flowable and context input files are maintained in the FEDEFL
    GitHub Repository: https://github.com/USEPA/fedelemflowlist
    
    The LCIA Formatter (https://github.com/USEPA/LCIAformatter) applies [Method]
    characterization factors to flows using the mapping housed in the FEDEFL.
    The flowable and context input files for [Method] are used by the LCIA Formatter
    to translate the names from the [Method] source file and generate a mapping
    file for the FEDEFL. This file contains all of the accepted flowable and context
    combinations which can be mapped to [Method] characterization factors. It also
    includes target UUID, units, and conversion factors as well as tracking
    who mapped and verified each record and when they were last updated.
