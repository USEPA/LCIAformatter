This ensures the application of TRACI 2.1 characterization factors when the general name of the metal is reported, as is the case in EPA datasets such as NEI and TRI. Duplicate names for flowables exist in TRACI 2.1 which have different characterization factors and different CAS. These occur due to duplicate entries in the source files for USEtox. In these cases, the entries with the currently recognized CAS are accepted and the other flowables are ignored. FEDEFL contexts are mapped to TRACI 2.1 to enable impact assessment across most of the possible contexts available within FEDEFL. Mappings that occur in the primary contexts (e.g. air) are assigned to all possible sub-contexts which apply. Where a context is non-specific in FEDEFL relative to the available TRACI 2.1 contexts (e.g. rural/urban), the LCIA Formatter applies the average of the relevant characterization factors from TRACI 2.1. Normalization and weighting factors are not provided in the TRACI 2.1 source file and are not added here.",
